## USE CODE MATT
yo you can use code `matt` on the Epic Games Store, **AND** the bottom right of the Fortnite item shop. You should try it out (and more importantly, give me money, like lots of money, like so much money, like insane amounts of money, like huge profits, insane profit margins, juse use code matt, not hard, its literally 4 letters) #ad :)

## about me

my main programming project right now is [doob](https://doobbot.com){:class="ext other"}, it's kinda a passion project because i've always wanted to start learning programming, and this has been fun making a Discord bot
