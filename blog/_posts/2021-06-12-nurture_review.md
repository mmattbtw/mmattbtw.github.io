## About

Nurture (stylized as 'nurture' through most of the promotional art), is Porter Robinson's sophomore album after 7 years since his EDM classic album "Worlds". Revealed by Robinson on an [aesthetic filled announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcKAdFEQ_JU){:class="ext youtube"} published on January 28, of 2020, it reveals the aesthetic we will see Porter use for the next year while hyping up the album. The then unreleased track "Mirror" playing in the background, really sets the tone in this video too.

After about 16 months of anticipation, nurture released on April 23rd, 2021 through the Mom+Pop label.

-----------------

## The Review

### (1.) Lifelike

Lifelike is a beautiful piano intro that really sets the mood for nurture. It is (what I feel) is the perfect introduction to the album, and is a good choice to place it at track #1.

### (2.) Look at the Sky

Look at the Sky an upbeat joyful, and some would describe "hopeful", song. This song was revealed during [Porter's Secret Sky 2020 set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KGsgpFiswQ){:class="ext youtube"}, at the end. After fans begged and begged, this song released as a single on January 27, 2021. Porter said in the description of the [Look at the Sky (Lyric Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuMz4v5PYKc){:class="ext youtube"} on YouTube, 

> "i see 'Look at the Sky' as a mantra to remind myself that thereâ€™s good reason for hope, and that people can meaningfully improve themselves and the world." 

I can see this throughout the entire song, with lyrics like:

**"I'll be alive next year**

**I can make something good, oh"**

and:

**"Shouldn't it come to you naturally?**

**And everyone knows (Oh)**

**You're losing your gift and it's plain to see**

**But then something must have changed in me**

**I don't fear it anymore**

**Now I'm sure**

**I'm sure"**

You can see Porter portraying this message throughout the song. These lyrics can be applied to really anything in life, which makes the song very relatable to a lot of people. This song is a banger, that really grew on me ever since the single released.

### (3.) Get Your Wish

Get Your Wish was the first single Porter released after announcing 'nurture'. The music video showing him standing on a screen with water placed on top of it, and behind him being another large screen. (This being the setup for the recently revealed 'nurture live' stage) This was the first taste of how nurture was going to sound, and is an amazing song in my opinion. [In a Twitter post](https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/1222580194248032258){:class="ext twitter"}, Porter explains that Get Your Wish is about, "finding a reason to keep moving forward." Porter then explains how during 2015 through 2017, Porter was doing really badly, and felt that his entire life revolved around music, and that for the first time in his music career, he was struggling to write new music. 

**"When the glory tries to tempt you**

**It may seem like what you need**

**But if glory makes you happy**

**Why are you so broken up??"**

I absolutely love this song, the production on this is amazing making it a banger during the chorus.

### (4.) Wind Tempos

When the next track (musician) came out as a single, [@alivenextyear](https://twitter.com/alivenextyear){:class="ext twitter"} on Twitter replied, [to Porter talking about how nurture needed an instrumental](https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/1367202814645178370){:class="ext twitter"}, saying, "oh cool so no instrumentals on the album." Porter jokingly responded with this banger tweet:

[![Porter's Tweet replying "INCORRECTO" to @alivenextyear](https://i.imgur.com/MmmIyRw.png)](https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/1367203283203424260)

Anyways, what I'm trying to get at here is that Wind Tempos is the first instrumental track in the tracklist. Yes, this means that there is at least 1 more. ;)

Wind Tempos is a **6 MINUTE** long instrumental track. This is the **LONGEST** track on nurture. While you might think that I keep emphasizing this because I think it's a bad thing, it's quite the opposite actually! I really do enjoy this song.

It is a very unique song, and *almost not* an interlude. It's not an interlude because of simply how long it is. However, it could be an interlude into the next track 'Musician', just because of the simplicity (yet complex composition) of the track. To say it's a simple song, would simply be wrong. Wind Tempos is a very calm and soothing track, that really captures Nature at its finest. Just a great track in general.

### (5.) Musician
Musician is the "last" single of nurture. [Revealed on February 26, of 2021 in a tweet by Porter which teases the single's music video in a split 6 second clip.](https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/1365378400286769158)

Musician is about Porter's struggles as a *Musician* after trying to follow up his debut album "Worlds". He talks about loving his past work, and wanting to create more music to be proud of, while also talking about not wanting to lose his love for music. This track also talks about subjects like burnout.

Musician also tackles Porter's scary realization that he could quit what was helping him through tough times, that being music.

Lyrics like:

**No, I don't wanna lose it, this emotion**

**I burn up, burn out**

**I shouldn't do this to myself**

**Then they say, "Fine**

**Well, do what you need to**

**But I don't wanna see you wasting your life**

**Now isn't it time you get a job?"**

I personally **LOVE** this song with a passion. The instrumental is AMAZING. With vocal chops from an unreleased Kero Kero Bonito x Porter Robinson collab. [Porter also demonstrated in a tweet on how he did it.](https://twitter.com/porterrobinson/status/1370086045711101956)

The "woo, yeah!" sample in the background is so good, and is permanently engrained in my mind when listening to this track.

That's really all I can say about this song, which is kind of surprising that I wouldn't say more since I have [over 250+ plays of this song as I am writing this.](https://www.last.fm/user/mmattbtw/library/music/Porter+Robinson/_/Musician?date_preset=ALL)
