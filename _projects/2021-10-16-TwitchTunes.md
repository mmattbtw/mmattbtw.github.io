This was a bot originally made for [Tajj](https://twitch.tv/tajj){:class="ext other"} , he wanted song requests on stream, however, he wanted to use Spotify. After some research, I went ahead and made it!

This project is pretty much complete/on hold because I don't really need/want to work on it, I've kinda gotten burnt out of this project.
