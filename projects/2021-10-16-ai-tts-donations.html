                    A Twitch bot that allows Donations to use AI TTS Voices <br>

    <main>
        <p>This is a project that was made specifically for <a href="https://twitch.tv/elpws" class="ext other">elpws</a> . He always wanted the AI TTS voices used on streamers like Forsen and xQc. I wanted to help him out, however I didn’t know of any way to use previous AI voices. I didn’t want to train a bunch of voices from scratch, so I didn’t know what to do for a while.</p>

<p>Until I got a whisper from <a href="https://twitch.tv/tajj" class="ext other">Tajj</a> . I didn’t know he whispered me until a couple days later, but as soon as he told me, I went ahead and got to work.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/tajj_screenshot.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This project uses the <a href="https://uberduck.ai">Uberduck.ai</a> API, which basically makes it so that we can use thousands of previously made voices that were trained by the community. There are some pros, and of course, some cons.</p>

<h3 id="pros">Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Thousands of previously made voices</li>
  <li>Voice training off the PC (no lag for streamer/training is offsite)</li>
  <li>Easy to use for the streamer+chatter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inconsistent amount of wait times.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes the TTS request takes a long time for the request to finish, however sometimes they happen instantly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request failures sometimes
    <ul>
      <li>This isn’t that much of a fail, since we are (or have) implemented a way to circumvent this by just trying the request again. (However, again, this increases waiting times)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Like some of my other projects, this one is still in heavy development, so stay tuned to the <a href="https://github.com/mmattDonk/ai-tts-donations" class="ext github">GitHub Repo</a> and the <a href="https://discord.gg/mvVePs2Hs2" class="ext other">Discord Server</a>.</p>
